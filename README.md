# WinZip 11
## Why WinZip 11?

### Since the recent release of Windows 11, the designs of Notepad, Paint, and several legacy apps have been tailored to the Windows 11 style. However, some apps have been left unattended. So I made one. It's an application that compresses or decompresses. The existing app is in a state of eating the CPU even though it hasn't moved, but the app I made doesn't eat it even if it doesn't move. The bright theme is still not implemented, but I think it's much better than the existing app that maintains a fully bright theme even though it's set as a dark theme.
